    "1. **Integers** - using **[BFV - Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren](https://www.inferati.com/blog/fhe-schemes-bfv)** which is the secong generation of FHE and is based on the RLWE - Ring-Learning with Errors. BFV is instantiated over two rings: 1) the plaintext ring which includes encodings of unencrypted or intelligible messages and 2) the ciphertext ring which includes encrypted messages. Similar to any other FHE scheme, BFV allows an untrusted party to induce meaningful computation over encrypted data without access to the decryption key. This is possible due to the homomorphism property which offers a map (or function) between the plaintext and ciphertext spaces that preserves the operations in these two spaces.\n",
    "2. **Real numbers** - using **[CKKS - Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song](https://www.inferati.com/blog/fhe-schemes-ckks)** which is Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers (HEAAN), was proposed to offer homomorphic computation on real numbers. The main idea is to consider the noise, a.k.a. error $ e$ , which is introduced in Ring-Learning with Errors (Ring-LWE) based FHE schemes for security purposes, as part of the message $\\mu $ (which we call here payload) we want to encrypt. The payload and the noise are combined to generate the plaintext ($\\mu + e$) that we encrypt.\n",
