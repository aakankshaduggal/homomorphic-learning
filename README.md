# Homomorphic Learning

The repository is dedicated to Methodology study for Multi-Party Learning also known as homomorphic learning.

## Project Goals


_Investigate the state of the art for homomorphic learning, both as a technique for privacy aware machine learning as well as the open source tooling ecosystem around it._

- **Literature survey:** Perform a literature survey on homomorphic learning to understand the state of the art from an abstract technique perspective and create a md file which highlightes different articles/papers along with brief summary of each.

- **Tooling survey:** Perform a tooling survey to understand the landscape of homomorphic learning tooling, with a particular focus on open source tooling.

- **Proof of concept use case:** Construct a demonstration of a basic homomorphic learning use case.

- **Blog post:** Creating a blog post summarizing above works.
